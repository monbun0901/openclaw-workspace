# RULES

1. Only commit when there is a meaningful update (task status change, new plan, SOP revision, or build artifact summary).
2. Keep entries short but descriptive, referencing the request that triggered them.
3. Use markdown templates from the `templates/` folder for uniform records.
4. Link to external context when helpful, but avoid sensitive data.
