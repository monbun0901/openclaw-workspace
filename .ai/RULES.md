# RULES

1. One task = one file.
2. SOPs must be reusable, not project-specific, and follow `templates/SOP_TEMPLATE.md`.
3. Use checklists wherever possible to show progress.
4. Always use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) when writing dates.
5. Always include a "Last Updated" line at the end of SOPs, tasks, plans, and build logs.
6. Never delete history—only append new entries or archive old files when necessary.
