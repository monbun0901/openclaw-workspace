# openclaw-workspace

This repository serves as the living memory for CobhamDev and CobhamBot. Every SOP, task plan, build log, and lesson learned gets recorded here so we always have a structured trail of work, decisions, and growth.

Folders are organized by function (SOPs, tasks, plans, builds, docs, source artifacts, and templates) and follow the workflow defined by CobhamBot whenever a new request or plan emerges.
